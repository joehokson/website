	<p>Up until a year or so ago, I was just struggling through life. I was working a pretty normal day job, coming home, eating dinner, watching some tv, then going to bed. Everything changed once I started meditating. Since then, I have been on a journey that has taken me through nine different countries and will eventually lead to a masters program at Stanford. I would have never thought any of this would be possible and it likely would not have been without meditation and a complete change in mindset.</p>
